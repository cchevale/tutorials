# Tutorials

This repository contains the self-learning tutorials that I wrote for myself and the colleagues I work with. It started with a `neo4j` hands-on tutorial that I prepared for a Winter school organized by the "Worlds of Related Coersions in Work" network (COST action #18205 WORCK) in Bielefeld, February 12-15, 2024.
